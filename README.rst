*Curate, visualize, and annotate your behavioral ephys data using Python*

**neurotic** is an app that allows you to easily review and annotate your
electrophysiology data and simultaneously captured video. It is an easy way to
load your Neo_-compatible data into ephyviewer_ without doing any programming.

To use the app, first organize your datasets in a YAML file like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my favorite dataset:
        description: This time it actually worked!

        data_dir:           C:/local_dir_containing_files
        remote_data_dir:    http://myserver/remote_dir_containing_downloadable_files  # optional
        data_file:          data.axgx
        video_file:         video.mp4
        # etc

        video_offset: -3.4  # seconds between start of video and data acq
        epoch_encoder_possible_labels:
            - label01
            - label02
        plots:
            - channel: I2
              ylim: [-30, 30]
            - channel: RN
              ylim: [-60, 60]
            # etc

        filters:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
            - channel: Force
              lowpass: 50
            # etc
        amplitude_discriminators:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
            - name: B3 neuron
              channel: BN2
              amplitude: [50, 100]
            # etc

    another dataset:
        # etc

Open your YAML metadata file in **neurotic** and choose a dataset. If the data
and video files aren't already on your local computer, the app can download
them for you. Finally, click launch and the app will use a standard viewer
layout to display your data to you using ephyviewer_.

|Example screenshot|

*(Pictured above is a voracious Aplysia californica in the act of making the
researcher very happy.)*

The viewers are easy and intuitive to navigate (see `User Interface`_):

- Pressing the play button will scroll through your data and video in real
  time, or at a higher or lower rate if the speed parameter is changed.
- The arrow/WASD keys allow you to step through time in variable increments.
- Jump to a time by clicking on an event in the event list or a table entry in
  the epoch encoder.
- To show more or less time at once, right-click and drag right or left to
  contract or expand time.
- Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in the trace viewer or video viewer.
- The epoch encoder can be used to block out periods of time during which
  something interesting is happening for later review or further analysis
  (saved to a CSV file).
- All panels can be hidden, undocked, stacked, or repositioned on the fly.

Electrophysiologists will find this tool useful even if they don't need the
video synchronization feature!

Installation
------------

**neurotic** requires PyAV_, which is most easily installed from conda-forge_.
It also does not explicitly list its dependencies within the package metadata
(see Notes_), so they must be installed manually.

Install **neurotic**, PyAV, and all other dependencies with these commands
(``pip`` may raise a non-fatal error that can be ignored during installation of
dependencies, see Notes_)::

    conda install -c conda-forge av
    pip install elephant>=0.6.2 ephyviewer>=1.1.0 neo>=0.7.2 numpy packaging pandas pylttb pyqt5 pyyaml quantities tqdm
    pip install neurotic

Getting started
---------------

Launch the standalone app from the command line::

    neurotic

A simple example is provided. Select the "example dataset", download the
associated data, and then click launch.

Command line arguments can be listed using ::

    neurotic --help

Questions and support
---------------------

Please post any questions, problems, comments, or suggestions in the `GitHub
issue tracker`_.

Notes
-----

Before **neurotic** can be configured to automatically install dependencies, an
`upstream library conflicts
<https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/elephant/issues/236>`__ must be fixed. This
should be resolved soon; until then, dependencies can be installed manually.
This warning may appear but can be ignored because the incompatibility between
these versions is trivial: ``ERROR: elephant 0.6.2 has requirement
neo<0.8.0,<=0.7.1, but you'll have neo 0.7.2 which is incompatible``.
